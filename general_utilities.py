"""
This file will define the general utility functions you will need for you implementation throughout this ex.
We suggest you start with implementing and testing the functions in this file.

NOTE: each function has expected typing for it's input and output arguments. 
You can assume that no other input types will be given and that shapes etc. will be as described.
Please verify that you return correct shapes and types, failing to do so could impact the grade of the whole ex.

NOTE 2: We STRONGLY encourage you to write down these function by hand and not to use Copilot/ChatGPT/etc.
Implementaiton should be fairly simple and will contribute much to your understanding of the course material.

NOTE 3: You may use external packages for fft/stft, you are requested to implement the functions below to 
standardize shapes and types.
